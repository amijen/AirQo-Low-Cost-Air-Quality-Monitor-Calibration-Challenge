# AirQo-Low-Cost-Air-Quality-Monitor-Calibration-Challenge
## Brief Description 

The objective of this competition is to predict the PM2.5 levels from satellite observations for eight cities in seven different countries in Africa. In fact, particulate matter (PM) includes microscopic matter suspended in air or water. Airborne particles are called aerosols. PM2.5 includes particles less than 2.5 µm in diameter. 

Training and testing datasets have no common cities. The challenge of this competition is to deal with a lot of features that présents also a huge amount of missing values, to extract the necessary informations and add the most suitable features. 

The challenge is part of the [Zindi competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/airqo-african-air-quality-prediction-challenge).
